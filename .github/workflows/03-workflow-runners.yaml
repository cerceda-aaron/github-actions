# Why we had to declare shell: bash in the windows runner?
# On Ubuntu, jobs use bash, so $RUNNER_OS works naturally.
# On windows, the default is powershell, which expects environments variables
# like $env:RUNNER_OS instead, so we had to override the default shell, forcing
# the step to run in bash, which understands the $RUNNER_OS syntax - just like on ubuntu
